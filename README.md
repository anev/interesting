### World economy before 1400.

There were several economical centers in the world in middle age. The biggest and the most advanced was the China. It was very powerful. China produced so many iron, food, another goods.

### Экономика Европы

Экономика Европы была полностью аграрной. Европа была очень населена, фактически обрабатывались все земли, а не только удобные. Возникло очень много городов, более 13 тысяч во всей европе. Как правило это были мелкие города по современным меркам. Например, Париж в 1000 году насчитывал около 80 тысяч человек и был одним из крупнейших городов Европы того времени. Кагда все замли распахали начали ездить и торговать. А также плавать и торговать, активная торговля - яркая черта средневековой Европы. На фоне торговли закладываются основные экономические институты в примитивных вариантах: прототип ООО, банков, инвестиций и прочего. 

The economy of the Europe was fully agrarial. Europe was very populated, in fact almost all ground was working up, not only good areas. Appeared lots of cities, more than 13 000 cities all over the Europe. Usually they were small cities, one or two thousand people. For example in 1000 about 80 thousand people inhabit Paris in 1000. And Paris was one of the biggest cities in Europe.
I mideval Europe trade was very important. Traders moved goods using roads, rivers and seas. At the time many econimic institution arised. Such as Ltd., banking, investment and so on,

### Черная смерть

Despite of many crisis in general the economy of Europe was sustanable enough. There were different crisis, because of climat changes, because of bad harvest and so on. Wars weren't sources of crisis, typycal war included rare battles between small armies.

And one day Black Death comes. About half of population dead during one year. People didn't know anything about bacteria and viruses, so they couldn't know about how desease is being spread. And of coarse they hadn't idea how to avoid it.

As a result grain prises decresed. Labor prises increased. Apperared lots of empty ground.
